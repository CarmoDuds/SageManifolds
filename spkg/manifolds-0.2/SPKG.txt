VERSION 0.2 (?? September 2013, svn revision 382):
------------------------------------------------
* change doctests to comply with Sage 5.11 (new ordering in symbolic expressions
resulting from some change in pynac, cf. http://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/9880)

* class Chart:
 - the coordinate ranges are now passed in the arguments (as intervals) and
   are used to set assumptions on the coordinates

* class MultiFunctionChart:
 - the various functions are now stored as instances of class FunctionChart
   (and no longer as symbolic expressions)
 - new methods: expr()
 - modified methods:
    - jacobian(): returns an array of FunctionChart
    - jacobian_det(): returns a FunctionChart

* class Point:
 - added fields name and latex_name
 - method change_coord() suppressed: the change-of-coordinate computation is
   now taken in charge by method coord()

* class DiffMapping:
 - new methods: multi_function_chart(), expr(), show(), pullback()
 - method new_coord_representation() changed to set_express()

* class Components and TensorField:
 - method mtrace() for component and tensor self-contraction
    using list of indices
