VERSION 0.3 (24 November 2013):
------------------------------------------------
* Changes towards a better integration in Sage:
    - Parent/Element scheme used for Manifold/Point
    - construction of objects via factory methods (no need to have the various class constructors in the global namespace)
    - use of the preparser tool <x,y,...> to explicitly set the coordinates in the global namespace

* New classes Domain and OpenDomain to deal with manifold subdomains: mappings and tensor fields can be now defined on subdomains only.

* class Manifold:
    - inherits from OpenDomain and Sage's Parent

* class Point:
    - inherits from Sage's Element

* class Chart:
    - the coordinates are no longer set by default to global variables: the preparser tool <,> must be used for this
    - added coordinate restrictions, subcharts and supercharts to deal with subdomains
    - new methods subchart(), transition_map(), valid_coordinates(), __getitem__()
    - method __call__() applies now to a point and returns the point's coordinates

* class DiffMapping:
    - mappings between manifolds now defined on subdomains
    - new method add_expr() in addition to set_expr()

* class Submanifold:
    - complete reorganization (in particular subclass MCurve has been suppressed)
    - method pushforward()added

* class VectorFrame:
    - added subframes and superframes to deal with subdomains

* class Components:
    - construction is now on the vector frame + number of indices

* class ScalarField:
    - new methods common_charts() and add_expr()
    - method gradient() renamed to differential()
    - multi-domain handling in the arithmetic

* class TensorField:
    - tensor fields are now defined on subdomains (instead of the whole manifold)
    - new method add_comp() in addition to set_comp()
    - method show() renamed to view()

* New example worksheets have been added (sphere S^2, de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces) and other worksheets have been updated
