- Chart: introduce a factory method function() or function_chart() to construct 
  a FunctionChart on self. 

- d'Alembert operator

- restore the (anti)symmetries after a up(g) or down(g) (raising/lowering on all the indices)

- tensor contractions: 
    - for tensor of rank 1 (i.e. vectors and 1-forms), get rid of the 0 in the position prescription, i.e. write "t.contract(2, v)" instead of "t.contract(2,v,0)", or (a being a 1-form),
    "a.contract(v)" instead of "a.contract(0, v, 0)". 
    - rename "TensorField.self_contract()" to "TensorField.trace()" ?
    - LaTeX input for specifying the contractions

- tensor product in Components: treat the symmetry of the output in the case of 
  tensor product with self in the case nid>1, e.g. A_{ij} A_{kl} (for the time
  being, only the case A_i A_j is treated)
  
- suppress explicit dependence on the coordinates in the LaTeX output of unspecified functions
  (i.e. write "u" instead of "u(x,y,z)"). 

- define "cuts" as submanifolds with some coordinate(s) set to constant

- define operators == and != in Manifold ?

- extrinsic geometry of pseudo-riemannian submanifolds

- plots of tensor fields

- compute geodesics

- compute integrals

- save to file

- parallelisation ?
