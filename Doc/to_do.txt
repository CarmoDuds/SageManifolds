IMPROVED EFFICIENCY:

- compute the action of a tensor on vectors and linear forms by taking into
  account the tensor symmetries/antisymmetries

- define operators == and != in Manifold ?

- include simplify_chain in chart.py ?


NEW FUNCTIONALITIES:

- d'Alembert operator

- restore the (anti)symmetries after a up(g) or down(g) (raising/lowering on all the indices)

- tensor product in Components: treat the symmetry of the output in the case of
  tensor product with self in the case nid>1, e.g. A_{ij} A_{kl} (for the time
  being, only the case A_i A_j is treated)

- define "cuts" as submanifolds with some coordinate(s) set to constant

- extrinsic geometry of pseudo-riemannian submanifolds

- plots of tensor fields

- compute geodesics

- compute integrals

- save to file (cf. sage: save?  and   sage: load?)

- permute the arguments of a tensor, e.g. from the (0,3)-tensor A, define a
  (0,3)-tensor B such that B(u,v,w) = A(w,v,u)

- catalog of pre-defined manifolds
