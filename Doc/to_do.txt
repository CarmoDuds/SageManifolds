- d'Alembert operator

- restore the (anti)symmetries after a up(g) or down(g) (raising/lowering on all the indices)

- tensor product in Components: treat the symmetry of the output in the case of 
  tensor product with self in the case nid>1, e.g. A_{ij} A_{kl} (for the time
  being, only the case A_i A_j is treated)
  
- define "cuts" as submanifolds with some coordinate(s) set to constant

- define operators == and != in Manifold ?

- extrinsic geometry of pseudo-riemannian submanifolds

- plots of tensor fields

- compute geodesics

- compute integrals

- save to file

- parallelisation
