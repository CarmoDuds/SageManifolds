Version 0.4 (10 February 2014)
===========
- class Domain:
    Parent/Element scheme used for Domain/Point, with Domain in the category of Sets
    members atlas, frames and coframes are now lists (and no longer dictionary)
- class Chart:
    member name suppressed
    new methods: __hash__ and __eq__
- class ScalarField:
    member express: now a dictionary with keys being the charts (and
    no longer their names)
- class DiffMapping:
    member coord_expression: now a dictionary with keys being the charts 
    (and no longer their names)
- class TensorField:
    member components: now a dictionary with keys being the vector frames
    (and no longer their names)
- class VectorFrame:
    method __call__ changed to __getitem__
    new methods: __hash__ and __eq__
- class CoFrame:
    method __call__ changed to __getitem__
- class CoordBasis renamed to CoordFrame
- class CompWithSym:
    corrected treatment of pre-existing symmetries in methods symmetrize and antisymmetrize

Version 0.3 (24 November 2013)
===========

- New classes to deal with manifold subdomains:
    Domain, OpenDomain
    introduced factory methods to build the various objects (charts, frames, 
    fields) on the domains
- class Manifold:
    inherits from OpenDomain and Sage's Parent class
- class Point:
    inherits from Sage's Element class
- class Chart:
    the coordinates are no longer set by default to global variables: the 
    operator <,> must be used for this 
    added coordinate restrictions, subcharts and supercharts
    new methods subchart(), transition_map(), valid_coordinates(), __getitem__()
    method __call__() applies now to a point and returns the point's coordinates
- class Components: 
    major change: construction is now on the vector frame + number of indices
- class VectorFrame:
    added subframes and superframes to deal with subdomains
- class ScalarField:
    arithmetic is now implemented on multiple domains
    new method common_charts()
    new method add_expr() in addition to set_expr()
    method gradient() renamed to differential()
- class TensorField:
    tensor fields are now defined on subdomains instead of the whole manifold
    new method add_comp() in addition to set_comp() 
    method show() renamed to view()
- class DiffMapping:
    mappings between manifolds are now defined on subdomains
- class Submanifold:
    complete reorganization; subclass MCurve suppressed
    method pushforward() added
- New example worksheets have been added: SM_sphere_S2

Version 0.2 (12 September 2013)
===========
svn revision 395

- class Chart:
    the coordinate ranges are now passed in the arguments (as intervals) and are 
    used to set assumptions on the coordinates
- class MultiFunctionChart:
    the various functions are now stored as instances of class FunctionChart 
    (and no longer as symbolic expressions)
    new method: expr()
    modified method: jacobian(): returns an array of FunctionChart instances
    modified method: jacobian_det(): returns a instance of FunctionChart
- class Point:
    added fields name and latex_name
    suppressed method change_coord(): the change-of-coordinate computation is 
    now taken in charge by method coord()
- class DiffMapping:
    new methods: multi_function_chart(), expr(), show(), pullback()
    method new_coord_representation() changed to set_express()
- class Components:
    new method: mtrace()
- class TensorField:
    new method: mtrace()
- Many doctests changed to comply with Sage 5.11 (new ordering in symbolic 
    expressions resulting from some change in pynac, cf. ticket 9880 on Sage Trac)
