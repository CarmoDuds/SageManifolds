SageManifolds
=============

This repository contains files of the
[SageManifolds project](https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/), except for
the Python source files and Sphinx source files, which 
are part of the SageMath sources hosted at https://git.sagemath.org/sage.git (and mirrored at https://github.com/sagemath/sage); the code under development is managed at https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/18528

Contents:
--------
./Doc: documentation about SageManifolds (except for the reference manual, which
is generated from the Sphinx source files)

./Gallery: some graphics produced with SageManifolds

./Notebooks: example Jupyter notebooks, most of them being posted on https://sagemanifolds.obspm.fr/

./Papers: articles about the SageManifolds project

./spkg: (deprecated) old SageManifolds packages and old install scripts (this is
