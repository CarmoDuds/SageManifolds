\section{Introduction}

Computer algebra for general relativity (GR) has a long history, which started
almost as soon as computer algebra itself in the 1960s. 
The first GR software was \soft{ALAM} (for \emph{Atlas Lisp Algebraic Manipulator})
witten by R.A. d'Inverno in 1969, who used it to compute
the Riemann and Ricci tensors of the Bondi metric. The original calculations took Bondi and his collaborators 6 months to go. The computation with \soft{ALAM} took 4 minutes and yield to the discovery of 6 errors in the original paper \cite{Skea94}. 
Since then, many packages have been developed and the reader is refered to \cite{MacCa02}
for a review of computer algebra
systems for GR prior to 2002 and to \cite{KorolKS13} for a more recent review,
focussing on tensor calculus, as well as to the semi-exhaustive list of
tensor calculus packages at \cite{xact_links}.

\section{Software for differential geometry}

Software packages for differential geometry and tensor calculus can be 
classified in two categories: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Applications atop general purpose computer algebra systems; 
notable examples are 
the \soft{xAct} suite \cite{Marti08,xAct} and \soft{Ricci} \cite{Ricci}, both
running atop \soft{Mathematica},
\soft{DifferentialGeometry} \cite{AnderT12,DiffGeom} integrated into \soft{Maple}, and \soft{Atlas 2}
\cite{Atlas2} for both \soft{Mathematica} and \soft{Maple}.
\item Standalone applications; recent examples are \soft{Cadabra} \cite{Peete07,Cadabra} (field theory),
\soft{SnapPy} \cite{SnapPy} (topology and geometry of 3-manifolds) and
\soft{Redberry} (tensors) \cite{BolotP13,Redberry}.
\end{enumerate}
All applications listed in the second category are free (open-source) software. In
the first category, \soft{xAct} and \soft{Ricci} are also free software, but
they run atop a proprietary product, the sources of which are closed (\soft{Mathematica}). 

As far as tensor calculus is concerned, the above packages can be distinguished by 
the type of computation that they perform: abstract index manipulations 
(\soft{xAct/xTensor}, \soft{Ricci}, \soft{Cadabra}, \soft{Redberry})
or component calculus (\soft{xAct/xCoba}, \soft{DifferentialGeometry}, \soft{Atlas 2})
In the first category, tensor operations such as contraction or covariant differentiation 
are performed by manipulating the indices themselves rather than the components 
to which they correspond. In the second category, vector bases are explicitely 
introduced on manifolds and tensor operations are carried out on the components 
in a given basis.

\section{An overview of Sage}

\soft{Sage} \cite{sage} is a free open-source mathematics software system, which is
based on the Python programming language. It makes use of dozens of pre-existing open-sources packages, 
among which \soft{Maxima} and \soft{Pynac} (symbolic calculations),
\soft{GAP} (group theory), 
\soft{PARI/GP} (number theory), \soft{Singular} (polynomial computations), 
and \soft{matplotlib} (high quality 2D figures). 
Sage provides a uniform Python interface to all these packages; however, 
Sage is not simply an interface: it contains a large and increasing part of 
original code (more than 750,000 lines, involving 5344 Python classes).
